title: Maximizing a Tree Series in the Representation Space
abstract: This paper investigates the use of linear representations of trees (i.e.
  mappings from the set of trees into a finite dimensional vector space which are
  induced by rational series on trees) in the context of structured data learning.
  We argue that this representation space can be more appealing than the space of
  trees to handle machine learning problems involving trees. Focusing on a tree series
  maximization problem, we first analyze its complexity to motivate the use of approximation
  techniques. We then show how a tree series can be extended to the continuous representation
  space, we propose an adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to solve the maximization
  problem in this space, and we establish convergence guarantees. Finally, we provide
  some experiments comparing our algorithm with an implementation of the Metropolis-Hastings
  algorithm in the space of trees.
