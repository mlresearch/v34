title: 'Grammar Compression: Grammatical Inference by Compression and Its Application
  to Real Data '
section: invited
abstract: 'A grammatical inference algorithm tries to find as a small grammar as possible
  representing  a potentially infinite sequence of strings. Here, let us consider
  a simple restriction: the input is a finite sequence or it might be a singleton
  set. Then the restricted problem is called the \em grammar compression to find the
  smallest CFG generating just the input. In the last decade many researchers have
  tackled this problem because of its scalable applications, e.g., expansion of data
  storage capacity, speeding-up information retrieval, DNA sequencing, frequent pattern
  mining,  and similarity search. We would review the history of grammar compression
  and its wide applications together with an important future work. The study of grammar
  compression has begun with the bad news: the smallest CFG problem is NP-hard. Hence,
  the first question is: Can we get a near-optimal solution in a polynomial time?  (Is
  there a reasonable approximation algorithm?) And the next question is: Can we minimize
  the costs of time and space? (Does a linear time algorithm exist within an optimal
  working space?) The recent results produced by the research community answer affirmatively
  the questions. We introduce several important results and typical applications to
  a huge text collection. On the other hand, the shrinkage of the advantage of grammar
  compression is caused by the data explosion, since there is no working space for
  storing the whole data supplied from data stream. The last question is: How can
  we handle the stream data? For this question, we propose the framework of \em stream
  grammar compression for the next generation and its attractive application to fast
  data transmission.'
