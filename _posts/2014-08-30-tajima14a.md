title: An example distribution for probabilistic query learning of simple deterministic
  languages
abstract: In this paper, we show a special example distribution on which the learner
  can guess a correct simple deterministic grammar in polynomial time from membership
  queries and random examples. At first, we show a learning algorithm of simple deterministic
  languages from membership and equivalence queries. This algorithm is not a polynomial
  time algorithm but, assuming a special example distribution, we can modify it to
  the polynomial time probabilistic learning algorithm.
