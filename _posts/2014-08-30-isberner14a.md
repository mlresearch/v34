title: An Abstract Framework for Counterexample Analysis in Active Automata Learning
abstract: Counterexample analysis has emerged as one of the key challenges in Angluin-style
  active automata learning.  Rivest and Schapire (1993) showed for the \mathrmL^*
  algorithm that a single suffix of the counterexample was sufficient to ensure progress.  This
  suffix can be obtained in a binary search fashion, requiring Θ(\log m) membership
  queries for a counterexample of length m. Correctly implementing this algorithm
  can be quite tricky, and its correctness sometimes even has been disputed. In this
  paper, we establish an abstract framework for counterexample analysis, which basically
  reduces the problem of finding a suffix to finding distinct neighboring elements
  in a 0/1 sequence, where the first element is 0 and the last element is 1. We demonstrate
  the conciseness and simplicity of our framework by using it to present new counterexample
  analysis algorithms, which, while maintaining the worst-case complexity of O(\log
  m), perform significantly better in practice. Furthermore, we contribute—in a second
  instantiation of our framework, highlighting its generality—the first sublinear
  counterexample analysis procedures for the algorithm due to Kearns and Vazirani
  (1994).
