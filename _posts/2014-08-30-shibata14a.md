title: Inferring (k,l)-context-sensitive probabilistic context-free grammars using
  hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes
abstract: 'Motivated by the idea of applying nonparametric Bayesian models to dual
  approaches for distributional learning, we define (k,l)-context-sensitive probabilistic
  context-free grammars (PCFGs) using hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes (PYPs). The
  data sparseness problem that occurs when inferring context-sensitive probabilities
  for rules is handled by the smoothing effect of hierarchical PYPs. Many possible
  definitions or constructions of PYP hierarchies can be used to represent the context
  sensitivity of derivations of CFGs in Chomsky normal form. In this study, we use
  a definition that is considered to be the most natural as an extension of infinite
  PCFGs defined in previous studies. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo method called blocked
  Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling is known to be effective for inferring PCFGs from
  unsupervised sentences. Blocked MH sampling is applicable to (k,l)-context-sensitive
  PCFGs by modifying their so-called inside probabilities. We show that the computational
  cost of blocked MH sampling for (k,l)-context-sensitive PCFGs is O(|V|^l+3|s|^3)
  for each sentence s, where V is a set of nonterminals. This cost is too high to
  iterate sufficient sampling times, especially when l â‰ 0, thus we propose an alternative
  sampling method that separates the sampling procedure into pointwise sampling for
  nonterminals and blocked sampling for rules. The computational cost of this sampling
  method is O(\min{|s|^l,|V|^l} (|V||s|^2+|s|^3) ). '
