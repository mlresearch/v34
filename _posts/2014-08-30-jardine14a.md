title: Very efficient learning of structured classes of subsequential functions from
  positive data
abstract: In this paper, we present a new algorithm that can identify in polynomial
  time and data using positive examples any class of subsequential functions that
  share a particular finite-state structure. While this structure is given to the
  learner \textita priori, it allows for the exact learning of partial functions,
  and both the time and data complexity of the algorithm are linear.   We demonstrate
  the algorithm on examples from natural language phonology and morphology in which
  the needed structure has been argued to be plausibly known in advance. A procedure
  for making any subsequential transducer onward without changing its structure is
  also presented.
