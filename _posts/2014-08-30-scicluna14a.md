title: Grammatical Inference of some Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars from Positive
  Data using Minimum Satisfiability
abstract: Recently, different theoretical learning results have been found for a variety
  of context-free grammar subclasses through the use of distributional learning (Clark,
  2010b). However, these results are still not extended to probabilistic grammars.
  In this work, we give a practical algorithm, with some proven properties, that learns
  a subclass of probabilistic grammars from positive data. A minimum satisfiability
  solver is used to direct the search towards small grammars. Experiments on typical
  context-free languages and artificial natural language grammars give positive results.
