title: Induction of Directed Acyclic Word Graph in a Bioinformatics Task
abstract: In this paper a new algorithm for the induction of a Directed Acyclic Word
  Graph (DAWG) is proposed.  A DAWG can serve as a very efficient data structure for
  lexicon representation and fast string matching, and have a variety of applications.
  Similar structures are being investigated in the theory of formal languages and
  grammatical inference, namely deterministic and nondeterministic finite automata
  (DFA and NFA, respectively). Since a DAWG is acyclic the proposed method is suited
  for problems where the target language does not necessarily have to be infinite.
  The experiments have been performed for a dataset from the domain of bioinformatics,
  and our results are compared with those obtained using the current state-of-the-art
  methods in heuristic DFA induction.
