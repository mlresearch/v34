title: Evaluation of selection in context-free grammar learning systems
abstract: Grammatical inference deals with learning of grammars describing languages.  Formal
  grammatical inference aims at identifying families of languages that have a shared
  property, which can be used to prove efficient learnability of the families formally.  In
  contrast, in empirical grammatical inference research, practical systems are developed
  that are applied to languages.  The effectiveness of these systems is measured by
  comparing the learned grammar against a Gold standard which indicates the ground
  truth. From successful empirical learnability results, either shared properties
  may be identified, leading to further formal learnability results, or modifications
  to the systems may be made, improving practical results.  Proper evaluation of empirical
  systems is, therefore, essential.  Here, we evaluate and compare existing state-of-the-art
  context-free grammar learning systems (and novel systems based on combinations of
  existing phases) in a standardized evaluation environment (on a corpus of plain
  natural language sentences), illustrating future directions for empirical grammatical
  inference research.
