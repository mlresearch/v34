title: Learning Nondeterministic Mealy Machines
abstract: 'In applications where abstract models of reactive systems are to be inferred,
  one important challenge is that the behavior of such systems can be inherently nondeterministic.
  To cope with this challenge, we developed an algorithm to infer nondeterministic
  computation models in the form of Mealy machines.  We introduce our approach and
  provide extensive experimental results to assess its potential in the identification
  of black-box reactive systems. The experiments involve both artificially-generated
  abstract Mealy machines, and the identification of a TFTP server model starting
  from a publicly-available implementation.  '
