title: A Canonical Semi-Deterministic Transducer
abstract: We prove the existence of a canonical form for semi-deterministic transducers
  with sets of pairwise incomparable output strings.  Based on this, we develop an
  algorithm which learns semi-deterministic transducers given access to translation
  queries.  We also prove that there is no learning algorithm for semi-deterministic
  transducers that uses only domain knowledge.
