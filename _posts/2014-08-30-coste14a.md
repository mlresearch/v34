title: A bottom-up efficient algorithm learning substitutable languages from positive
  examples
abstract: 'Based on Harris’s substitutability criterion, the recent definitions of
  classes of substitutable languages have led to interesting polynomial learnability
  results for expressive formal languages. These classes are also promising for practical
  applications: in natural language analysis, because definitions have strong linguisitic
  support, but also in biology for modeling protein families, as suggested in our
  previous study introducing the class of local substitutable languages. But turning
  recent theoretical advances into practice badly needs truly practical algorithms.
  We present here an efficient learning algorithm, motivated by intelligibility and
  parsing efficiency of the result, which directly reduces the positive sample into
  a small non-redundant canonical grammar of the target substitutable language.  Thanks
  to this new algorithm, we have been able to extend our experimentation to a complete
  protein dataset confirming that it is possible to learn grammars on proteins with
  high specificity and good sensitivity by a generalization based on local substitutability.'
