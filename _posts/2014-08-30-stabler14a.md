title: Towards a rationalist theory of language acquisition
section: invited
abstract: Recent computational, mathematical work on learnability extends to classes
  of languages that plausibly include the human languages, but there is nevertheless
  a gulf between this work and linguistic theory. The languages of the two fields
  seem almost completely disjoint and incommensurable. This paper shows that this
  has happened, at least in part, because the recent advances in learnability have
  been misdescribed in two important respects. First, they have been described as
  resting on ‘empiricist’ conceptions of language, when actually, in fundamental respects
  that are made precise here, they are equally compatible with the ‘rationalist’,
  ‘nativist’ traditions in linguistic theory. Second, the recent mathematical proposals
  have sometimes been presented as if they not only advance but complete the account
  of human language acquisition, taking the rather dramatic difference between what
  current mathematical models can achieve and what current linguistic theories tell
  us as an indication that current linguistic theories are quite generally mistaken.
  This paper compares the two perspectives and takes some first steps toward a unified
  theory, aiming to identify some common ground where ‘rationalist’ linguistic hypotheses  could
  directly address weaknesses in the current mathematical proposals.
