title: 'Bigger is Not Always Better: on the Quality of Hypotheses in Active Automata
  Learning'
abstract: In Angluin’s L^∗ algorithm a learner constructs a sequence of hypotheses
  in order to learn a regular language. Each hypothesis is consistent with a larger
  set of observations and is described by a bigger model. From a behavioral perspective,
  however, a hypothesis is not always better than the previous one, in the sense that
  the minimal length of a counterexample that distinguishes a hypothesis from the
  target language may decrease.  We present a simple modification of the L^∗ algorithm
  that ensures that for subsequent hypotheses the minimal length of a counterexample
  never decreases, which implies that the distance to the target language never increases
  in a corresponding ultrametric.  Preliminary experimental evidence suggests that
  our algorithm speeds up learning in practical applications by reducing the number
  of equivalence queries.
